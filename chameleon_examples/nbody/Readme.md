## N-body Benchmark

N-body is a numerical simulation that approximates the evolution of a system of bodies. Each body continuously interacts with every other body. One of examples is an astrophysical simulation in which each body represents a galaxy or an individual star, and the bodies attract each other through the gravitational force.

N-body simulation is used in various computational science problems. For example, protein folding uses N-body simulation to calculate electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Turbulent fluid flow simulation and lobal illumination computation in computer graphics are other examples of problems that use N-body simulation.

## Requirements

## Versions

In this repo, we have different versions of N-body simulation. The main source code is refered at https://pm.bsc.es/gitlab/ompss-2/examples/nbody/-/tree/master/. The detail includes:

01.nbody_seq_nonblk: sequential non-blocking version
02.nbody_seq_blk: sequential blocking version
