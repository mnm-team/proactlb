\section{Structuring the thesis as a task flow}
\label{App_C_sec:intro_taskflow}

This Appendix shows the structure of this thesis outlined as a task flow, where the thesis's main points, keywords, or key paragraphs are described as a task. There are five figures shown here, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Figure \ref{fig:thesistaskflow_chapter1}: the taskflow of Chapter 1 - Introduction.
	\item Figure \ref{fig:thesistaskflow_chapter2}: the taskflow of Chapter 2 - From work stealing to reactive load balancing, associated with related works.
	\item Figure \ref{fig:thesistaskflow_chapter3}: the taskflow of Chapter 3 - Performance modeling and analysis.
	\item Figure \ref{fig:thesistaskflow_chapter4}: the taskflow of Chapter 4 - A proactive approach for dynamic load balancing.
	\item Figure \ref{fig:thesistaskflow_chapter567}: the taskflows of Chapters 5, 6, 7 - Corresponding to proof of concepts, evaluation, and conclusions in this thesis.
\end{itemize}
