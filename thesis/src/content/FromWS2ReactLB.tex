Based on the overview in Chapter \ref{ch:Introduction}, Chapter \ref{ch:wstoreactlb} provides in more detail terminologies, task-based programming models and runtimes, applications and state-of-the-art related to dynamic load balancing in distributed memory systems. The content of Chapter \ref{ch:wstoreactlb} is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:chapter_two_overview} as an inverted pyramid. First, the top view of parallel computing is shown in Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} and we describe in more detail the concepts as well as terminologies associated with the architecture of distributed memory systems. Second, we go in-depth on how programming models are designed for shared and distributed memory systems in Section \ref{sec:taskbased_prog_models}. Hereby, task-based parallel programming models are emphasized as an instrument to research dynamic load balancing. Following that, task-based parallel runtimes and applications are addressed as the objects introduced in Section \ref{sec:taskbased_runtimes_apps}. Finally, the related work from work stealing to reactive load balancing is analyzed in Section \ref{sec:relatedwork}.
