This chapter shows the implementation of our proactive load balancing approach. The implementation is built upon a task-based parallel framework named Chameleon \cite{Klinkenberg2020ChameleonReactLB}, which supports task-based applications running on shared and distributed memory. In our proactive load balancing approach, integrating an online load prediction model cannot be fixed in a specific application. Besides that, proactive task offloading methods are intended to be customized on the user side. Therefore, we design the implementation as a plugin tool upon Chameleon. Users can be flexible to adjust prediction model and task migration strategy before execution, even load balancing algorithm. This chapter is outlined as the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We describe the Chameleon framework in Section \ref{sec:PoC-Chameleon}.
	\item We present our implementation designed as a plugin tool upon Chameleon in Section \ref{sec:cham_proactlb_tool}.
	\item We show an example of putting Chameleon and the plugin tool together in Section \ref{sec:cham_proactlb_example}.
\end{enumerate}

% We show two frameworks, namely Chameleon \cite{Klinkenberg2020ChameleonReactLB} and Taskflow C++ \cite{huang2020cpp}. Chameleon is a task-based parallel programming framework supporting HPC applications in terms of shared and distributed memory. Taskflow C++ is developed to help quickly write parallel and heterogeneous task programs at a single node.
